                            My journey with Habitat for Humanity started about 20 years ago and I’ve learned so much from these unique experiences — from working alongside volunteers to turning over homes for families, and eventually seeing their lives transform.

                            I have started business at a young age because of my grandfather.
                            When one of our sister companies encountered a major problem, my grandfather asked us to help. So I, together with our team, did our best and even made sacrifices to address this.
